Vultur Framework
================

Originally named Condor Framework by me and that's why it uses the CR prefix on it's classes. I changed the name to <acronym title="Vultur gryphus">Vultur</acronym> because it is the scientific name of the Andean Condor.

I developed this framework for a personal project and have been using it extensively on client work. I was driven to write Vultur because I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could pull it off and to further develop my PHP and Web development skills. 

I had used other frameworks (Zend and Yii) but hated the fact that they included too much functionality I didn't need and sometimes the documentation was scarce or confusing, so I wanted something I knew all around and what better way than to create one.

I won't promise any extensive documentation since I really developed this software for internal use, but shortly I will provide with examples on how to use it.
